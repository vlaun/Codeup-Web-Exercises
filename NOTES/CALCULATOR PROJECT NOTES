#group activity - list out features a calculator.
    -take in input
        -add event listers to each button
        -determine what we want that function or functions to do
            Options:
            1.  add a new function for each button
                ex. add function, five function, etc..

            2.  add the same function on each button's click event
                ex. function handleButton () {
                var objectJustClicked = this;
                if objectJustClicked.getAttribute('class') == "number") {
                    handleNumber(objectJustClicked);
                } else if(objectJustClicked.getAttribute('class') == "operator") {
                } ....
              }
            3.  add an event lister to buttons that are numbers that calls the handleNumber()
                function/, then add event lister to buttons that are operators that calls handleOperator()

    - determining if the button is a number or an operator
        -if the button is a number,keep appending the numbers
        -if the button clicked is an operator - get ready to accept the next numberic input
        -if the operator display has something in it, then put new numberic inputs to the 2nd number display
        -how to handle a clear button (does it clear everything that was inputed) - reset variables
        -since it's JS, don't forget that "1" + 1 = "11", parseInt("1") + parseInt(1) = 2

If your displays are HTML inputs - then you'll use the .value attribute to paint the screen
If your displays are other HTML elements - use .innerHTML or .innerText



    -calculate the result
    -produce output
    -get the output onto the screen

    ##Yes, the process can be oversimplified to input->process->output, but what's really
      going on step by tiny step
   ###List out the specific steps that need to happen in order to


   <button id="one"></button>

   document.getElementById('one')
        .addEventListener('click', function() {
            //if there's no operator selected yet, paint the number one to the left input
            //if there is an operator selected, paint the number one to the right output
         });

   document.getElementById('multiply')
        .addeventListener('click', function() {
            var leftInput = document.getElemen tById('leftInput').value;
            var rightInput = docuent.getElementById('rightInput').value;
            var result = leftInput * rightInput;
            //clear out all the inputs
            //set the .value or .innerHTML of the input to hold the nuew result
         });
